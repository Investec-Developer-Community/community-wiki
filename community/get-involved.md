### What roles are there in the community?

We view the community like ~~a marketing funnel~~ orbits in a solar system ðŸ’«. The more Gravity X Love you have for the community, the closer to the core you get. i.e. 4 = Pluto & 1 = the sun, if we are talking orbits of celestial bodies.

| Orbit Level |      Name     |         Characterised by         |
| :---------: | :-----------: | :------------------------------: |
|      4      |   Exploring   |  Newcomers and passive observers |
|      3      | Participating |    Casually involved regulars    |
|      2      |  Contributing | Active coordinators & Volunteers |
|      1      |    Leading    |    Trusted leaders & advocates   |
