## Becoming a community champ

We run a [**community champions program**](community-champions.md), where our most engaged community members are recognised and rewarded for their efforts in supporting and contributing to the community.

Our community champs enable and support others to grow and learn and are integral to the community.

👉 You can request to join the Champs program or nominate a fellow community member [**here**](https://jf18emj1p49.typeform.com/to/w75Wtkts).

## What's the swag like?

Check out a few things we give to awesome community members who live [**our core principles and values**](community-manifesto.md#core-principles-and-values)**.** 👇
