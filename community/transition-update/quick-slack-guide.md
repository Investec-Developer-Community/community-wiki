# Quick Slack Guide

## Hey there!

Alright, buckle up, Programmable Banking cadets! 🚀 We're about to embark on an epic journey through the digital cosmos. Our destination? A brand new Programmable Banking Community Slack workspace! So, grab your space helmets and let's get this show on the road!

## Why the move?

Hey there, fellow fintech explorers! We've got some big news. We're packing up our digital belongings and setting a course for our very own dedicated Slack workspace. Why, you ask? Well, it's like finding a new planet that's even better suited for our community life. More features, more fun, more... space! So, get ready for an adventure!

## 🪂 Before the Big Jump&#x20;

* **Heads Up!** 📣: We'll be sending out a broadcast in our current workspace to let everyone know about our upcoming voyage. We'll fill you in on why we're blasting off and all the stellar features we'll have in our new digital space station.
* **Setting Up** 🛠️: We will be hard at work setting up our new Slack workspace. We'll make sure it feels just like home with familiar channels, settings, and all those handy integrations we can't live without.
* **Invites Coming Your Way** 💌: Keep an eye on your mail! We'll be sending out invites to join the new workspace. It's like a galactic housewarming party, but online!

### 🚚 During the Move&#x20;

* **RSVP to the Party** 🎉: Once you get the invite, click on the link to join the new Slack workspace and set up your profile. You can use the same profile info as before, no need to reinvent the wheel... or the spaceship!
* **Find Your Favorite Rooms** 🏠: After you've set up your profile, join the channels \[Will update this with the links] that you were part of in the old workspace. It's like finding your favourite rooms in a new spaceship.
* **Pack Your Important Stuff** 📦: If there are any important messages or threads you want to keep, save them and manually copy them over to the new workspace. We’ll transfer the last 90 days of public posts. It's like packing your favourite space suit for the journey.
* **Set Your House Rules** 📜: Set up your notification preferences in the new workspace. It's like setting spaceship rules for when fellow crew members can drop by.

### 🏁 After the Move&#x20;

* **We're Here to Help** 🤝: Moving can be a bit of a space whirl, but we're here to help. If you have any questions or run into any space debris, give us a shout.
* **Tell Us How We Did** 📝: Once you're settled in, we'd love to hear what you think about the new spaceship. Your feedback will help us fix any issues and make our new workspace even better.
* **Goodbye, Old House** 👋: After everyone's moved (and of course no one is getting removed from the Offerzen Workspace, the home space of the Programmable Banking community is just moving) and we're sure we didn't leave anything behind, we'll say goodbye to our old workspace. We'll let you know when this is happening so it's not a surprise.

### Wrapping Up

We know that moving can be a big change, but we're super excited about this new adventure. We're here to make this transition as smooth as possible, and we can't wait to start this new chapter with you in our new Slack workspace. If you have any questions or just want to chat about the move, don't hesitate to reach out.
