# ðŸŽ¯ API | No-code Budget Expense App

## Purpose of this tutorial

This tutorial will show you how to set up the framework for a no-code/ low-code mobile budget expense app that can leverage your Investecâ€™s Programmable Banking transactions with [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/).

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ¤© The idea of doing it as a no-code/low-code challenge in 90 mins is not to get all fancy and technical. But to realise that creating something with real-world implications is fun - who knows - it might spark a cool idea for later! Itâ€™s just for funsies.&#x20;

Feel free to share your progress/ final build [in Slack](https://offerzen-community.slack.com/archives/C047HMLESSE) - we would love to see how youâ€™ve built on this further!
