# üí∏ How to make a payment

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/733e3023bc8844e186e1752134570527" %}

In addition to retrieving historical data from your account, the Investec üè¶ Private Banking API allows you to programmatically make payments to beneficiaries on your account. This functionality is not yet available on the üß∞ CIB API.

Let‚Äôs explore how to make a payment to an existing beneficiary on your account using the community-contributed [**Postman Collection**](https://www.postman.com/investec-open-api/workspace/programmable-banking/overview).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro-Tip:** You can only make programmatic payments to beneficiaries that have been paid at least once before with regular online banking from your account.
{% endhint %}

As with accounts, every beneficiary on your banking profile also has a unique ID. You can retrieve the list of beneficiaries from the following endpoint: https://openapi.investec.com/za/pb/v1/accounts/beneficiaries. Again, you use a bearer token for authentication as with all API requests to the Investec API, and a typical response has the following structure:&#x20;

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "beneficiaryId": "LOREMIPSUMDOLOR=",
      "accountNumber": "1234567890",
      "code": "123456",
      "bank": "ACME CORP",
      "beneficiaryName": "Jane Smith",
      "lastPaymentAmount": "1.00",
      "lastPaymentDate": "10/01/2023",
      "cellNo": null,
      "emailAddress": null,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "referenceAccountNumber": "LOREM IPSUM DOLOR",
      "referenceName": "LOREM IPSUM",
      "categoryId": "112233445566",
      "profileId": "77889900"
    },
  ],
  "links": {
    "self": "https://openapi.investec.com/za/pb/v1/accounts/beneficiaries"
  },
  "meta": {
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

The [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/investec-open-api/workspace/programmable-banking/request/26868804-1bc46536-5cf4-4c41-8fe7-0f77ce9f0d90) has a request for this named Beneficiaries (in the Beneficiaries folder)

Now that you have a beneficiary ID, let‚Äôs make a small payment to them. For that, we‚Äôll be using https://openapi.investec.com/za/pb/v1/accounts/{accountId}/paymultiple.

The endpoint receives an array list of payments, as it‚Äôs able to process multiple payments at one point. Payments are easily defined and have four key fields:

```json
{
  "paymentsList": [
    {
      "beneficiaryId": "01234567890",
      "amount": "10",
      "myReference": "API transfer",
      "theirReference": "API transfer"
    }
  ]
}
```

As you will see, you have full programmatic control of the process and it does not require additional manual verification.
