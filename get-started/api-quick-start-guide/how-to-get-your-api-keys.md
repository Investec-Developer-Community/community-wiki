{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/28eda68190434b8fb96285f530777987" %}

To start using the Investec API, you must first obtain credentials (client ID and secret) for programmatic access.&#x20;

API keys can be created with specified permissions and are used to authenticate your requests so that you can transact securely against your Investec account.&#x20;
