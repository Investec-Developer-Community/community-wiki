{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/28eda68190434b8fb96285f530777987" %}

To start using the Investec API, you must first obtain credentials for programmatic access. These are used to authenticate your requests so you can transact securely against your Investec Account.

Before doing so, you must first enrol your Investec Private Bank or CIB account for Programmable Banking functionality. ([See Self-Enrollment Guide](../self-enrollment-guide.md))

You can do so by navigating [Investec Online ](https://login.secure.investec.com/wpaas/usrroot-wpaas/login/form)and selecting _Manage -> Investec Developer,_ after which you can accept the terms and conditions and enrol.

Now that you have an Investec Account with Programmable Banking enabled, you can retrieve your API credentials online.

🏦 **Private Banking Account**: You can find your client\_ID and client\_secret in the _Manage_--> _Investec Developer -> Individuals Connections_ section of Investec Online.

🧰 **CIB Account**: You can find your client\_ID and client\_secret in the _Manage_--> _Investec Developer -> Business Connections_ section of Investec Online.

You will also want to create an API key. Click the _Create new API key_ button and follow the instructions.

Please note that only the main account holder will have access to these credentials and the ability to create new API keys.
