# 👤 How to authenticate

Before you query the Investec API for an account’s history, you must first authenticate. This is how the Investec API safeguards your account.

You must first retrieve a secure access token, formally called a bearer token, to be used in all outbound API calls.

There is a community-contributed [**Postman Collection**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] that we recommend you fork as you follow along. The Postman collection includes both the 🏦 Private Banking and 🧰 Corporate Investment Banking (CIB) APIs.

To get a bearer token:

* Send an API request to the https://openapi.investec.com/identity/v2/oauth2/token endpoint.
* The endpoint receives your client ID and client secret as [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) authentication headers. Additionally, you must send your API key in an x-api-key header.
* The request body must have a field grant\_type with value client\_credentials.
* It will return a bearer token that you can use in all subsequent API requests. The token is valid for 30 minutes, and you can always request a new one.

The Postman collection comes with an "Authentication -> 200 - OK" request that you can can run with your account credentials to try this out for yourself. 🎉\\

You will want to set your credentials as variables in the collection for ease of reuse. The collection comes with client\_id, client\_secret and api\_key variables. You'll find the Variables tab after selecting the Edit menu.

If your keys are valid, the response will contain the token and an expiration when you send the request.

Here’s an example response:

```json
{
  "access token": "qwertyuiop123456789",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "1799",
  "scope": "accounts",
 }
```
