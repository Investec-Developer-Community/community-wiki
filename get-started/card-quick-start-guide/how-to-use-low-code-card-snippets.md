# üöÄ How to use low-code card snippets

If you're not confident with coding yet, we've got you covered. There are 3 different card code snippets to choose from, which can be added to your programmable card at the click of a button.&#x20;

1. Navigate to the Investec Developer homepage by clicking on **‚ÄúManage‚Äù**, followed by **‚ÄúInvestec Developer‚Äù**.&#x20;

3.  There are 3 different card code snippets from which to choose:&#x20;

    1. **Update transaction limit :** Modify the per-transaction limit on your card
    2. **Limit your card to a specific merchant:** Restrict your card transactions to specific merchants (ie. only Woolworths)
    3. **Limit transactions to specific merchant categories:** Restrict your card transactions to specific merchant categories (ie. only petrol service stations).&#x20;

    The steps are the same for each code snippet. For the purpose of this guide, we'll use the "Update transaction limit" code snippet. **Click on the tile.**

4. You will be taken to the programmable card screen. Ensure your card is enabled by toggling the button. **Click on the card to view the code snippet.**&#x20;

3. An explanation of the code snippet is provided in the next screen.

* The code in the **main.js file** will be updated automatically and doesn't require any edits.
* The code in the **env.json file** requires that you set the limit for the transaction limit.&#x20;

Following this, you have the option to:

1. **Publish the code**
2. Make additional edits in the IDE.

6. Once you click **"Publish"** , you will be asked if you are sure you want to publish the code. It will overwrite the code currently on the card.&#x20;
