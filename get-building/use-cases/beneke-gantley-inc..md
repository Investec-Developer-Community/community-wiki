### The Problem: Manual data entry and upload to LawPracticeZA software

The process of downloading bank statements, formatting them, and then uploading them to LawPracticeZA is tedious and time-consuming. Beneke Gantely was spending a lot of time going through this manual process every week.&#x20;

### &#x20;The Solution: Automated syncing of transaction data

* The team at Beneke Gantely integrated their Programmable Banking account with LawPracticeZA.
* The integration allows all of their account transactions to be fed directly into LawPracticeZA and the transactions to sync twice a day.

### Winning with Programmable Banking&#x20;

* The integration with Programmable Banking completely removed the need for the Beneke Gantley team to manually upload statements each week.&#x20;
