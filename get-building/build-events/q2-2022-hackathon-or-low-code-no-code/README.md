Hey Peeps!!!

We were blown away by all the amazing projects you built and submitted for [our Q4 hackathon last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cWZQtru2zXkkVjEnbOZiCbwbTW1LcpgEsUalt1Vwlog/edit#gid=417688078) and hope you are ready for the next one!

Starting in quarter two this year, our hackathon theme is _Low-code/ No-code with_ [_Spreadsheet Banking_](https://www.spreadsheetbanking.dev/) _(Read the origin_ [_blog post here_](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/programmable-banking-community-banking-on-spreadsheets)_)._

Our goal for this Hackathon is to **show the power of programmable banking and how it can be made more accessible for non-tech users**.&#x20;

> If you're keen to jump in already, [**register to participate** **or be a team mentor here**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/edFvATSl).

### **What is this hackathon about?**

This is a virtual community hackathon. The challenge is to create **useful solutions for non-technical peeps** using [Investec Programmable Banking](https://www.investec.com/en\_za/banking/programmable-banking.html) with [Spreadsheet Banking](https://www.spreadsheetbanking.dev/).

{% hint style="success" %}
Stay updated with the Spreadsheet Banking build [here](https://loom.com/share/folder/faed2f32b3c740a6b67e96015df77bcc) and in our [Slack channel](https://offerzen-community.slack.com/archives/CUBJ511K8).&#x20;

You and your team are the credited ‚Äòowners‚Äô of your ideas, code and content. However, in the [spirit of the community](../../../community/community-manifesto.md), you are required to open source your code under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT); see Rules and FAQs for more info.\
\
You can chat with us in the dedicated [**Hackathon Slack channel**](https://offerzen-community.slack.com/archives/C03CC6RJHDG) or email us at [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com).

### **Who can participate?**

You may participate alone, but we highly recommend working in a team.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that at least one person on your team must have access to an [Investec Private Bank Account](https://www.investec.com/en\_za/banking/programmable-banking.html) and have Programmable Banking activated on their account ([developer docs here](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#programmable-banking)) - as you need to build a solution that is integrated with it.
{% endhint %}

**The closing date for your final solution is Friday 22 July, 23:59 SAST.**

Each submission must include:

* [ ] A link to an app/system/solution that has been released under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and uses the Spreadsheet Banking app \[you can also use the [Investec Programmable Card](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#features-included) and other features on [Investec Open API](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#open-api)].
* [ ] Clear and shareable documentation for setting up your solution.
* [ ] Two-minute video/ live demo of your solution showing how to use it and how it solves a business user's problem.
* [ ] A brief description of the problem your solution solves, how your solution works and how it makes use of Programmable Banking and [Spreadsheet banking](https://www.spreadsheetbanking.dev/), as well as the benefits of your solution (see [one-page pitch template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yk5F009f-4KPG9moysxEX40mmL1M45d0VCQj1zsOyHk/edit?usp=sharing) that should be used)
* [ ] **Optional team photo üíú.**

> [**Register here to join the Hackathon**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/edFvATSl) and let us know in the entry form if you also require access to a live demo/ community account - rather than using your own Investec account.

## High-level things

Please reach out to [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) with any questions.&#x20;

Your team should build a solution that uses the Spreadsheet Banking app as part of your Investec's Programmable Banking solution to show how businesses can make life easier or create efficiencies for others.&#x20;

You must use the [Spreadsheeting banking app](https://spreadsheetbanking.dev/) in some way in your solution.

### üí° **Pro Tips:**&#x20;

* Make sure you understand the Primary Criteria (**below**) before coming up with ideas.&#x20;
* Focus on the use case - you should explain the problem you are trying to solve, how someone would use your solution and why.
* Please **keep it simple**. If your solution saves someone 5 minutes a week - that's a meaningful impact on a real person's life!&#x20;
* Try to find smart workarounds if a platform limits you. **Your solution doesn't need to be rolled out at scale to score well.**&#x20;
* Ensure it works in production. For example, if you need to demonstrate a payment with a card, use SnapScan and donate R1.00 to a good cause.&#x20;
* [Steal ideas](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/great-entrepreneurs-steal-ideas-walker-deibel/), but credit sources.

### **Hackathon Details:**

#### **Teams:**

* Team size 1- 6 with one submission per team**.**&#x20;
* You can be in multiple teams - it's all about the submitted solutions.&#x20;
* Teams must have access or a way to access the Programmable Banking API / card functionalities to leverage them for the hackathon. (You can also [request access to a live Community Investec account](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) or [create a local API simulator](https://github.com/devinpearson/programmable-banking-sim).)

1. **Quality of the idea**: simplicity, creativity and originality of the idea&#x20;
2. **Potential strategic impact**: potential for improving businesses&#x20;
3. **Implementation of the concept**: ease of use, documentation and source code

## FAQs

<details>

<summary><strong>How many people can be on my team? Can I enter alone?</strong></summary>

You may enter alone or in a team. Please try to keep team sizes (1-5).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I/ my team apply more than once?</strong></summary>

You may apply as many times as you want - but each application needs to be accompanied by a unique submission. We reserve the right to reject any application and will probably ask you to rather focus on one submission and make it really good.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I be part of multiple teams?</strong></summary>

You can, but given the short time frame, we find the best and most thought out solutions come from people/ teams who focus on solving one problem at a time. It also helps when it comes time to divide up the winnings - who contributed most to the winning solution? :)

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>I don't have Programmable Banking; can I participate?</strong></summary>

* You will need to get access to an account either by opening one, getting permission to access one from an account holder, or working in a team with someone who does have access. You can find out more about opening an account and accessing Programmable Banking here: P[rogrammable banking for software developers](https://www.investec.com/en\_za/banking/programmable-banking.html).
* An Investec Private Bank account holder will need to get Programmable Banking activated on their account by asking their Investec Private Banker.
* If you prefer **access to a general community live test account**, please [register your intent to participate](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/edFvATSl) in the Hackathon before submissions open.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What happens after the hackathon?</strong></summary>

* Teams will be asked to present technical demos of their solutions at future Programmable Banking Community Meetups.
* OfferZen may reach out to you about publishing your solution pitch and demo on the [OfferZen Blog](https://www.offerzen.com/blog) to showcase it to the [companies](https://www.offerzen.com/companies/public\_list) and [developers](https://www.offerzen.com/nl/community) that use OfferZen.
