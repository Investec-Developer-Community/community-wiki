# Get Support

Hey there! ðŸ˜Š

We're all about giving our community the superpowers they need to get creative and make something awesome. We believe in keeping things open, friendly, and clear because teamwork makes the dream work, right? So, we've cooked up a **super simple support system to guide you through any bumps or questions** you might run into.

## Getting the Support You Need

For <mark style="background-color:yellow;">immediate assistance</mark> and to engage with fellow community champions and Investec developers, head over to our Slack channel:

* **Slack Channel**: [#05\_pb-api-support-feedback](https://investec-dev-com.slack.com/archives/C05MQQDUJ3E)

Here, you can ask questions, share insights, or find out if there's an existing workaround for your issue.

### Step 2: Feature Requests & General Discussions

If you have a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">feature request</mark> or want to start a general discussion about the Programmable Banking API and Card, please use our GitHub discussions section:

* **GitHub Discussions**: [Investec Developer Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Investec-Developer-Community/discussions)

This is the perfect place to share ideas and collaborate on potential enhancements.

### Step 3: Reporting Technical Issues

For <mark style="background-color:yellow;">technical issues that require attention</mark>, you have two options:

1.  **GitHub Discussions**: You can add your issue to the discussions for community input.

## Our Commitment to You

The API team is dedicated to reviewing all outstanding issues and discussion points. We will respond to and/or assign issues to the relevant team members for resolution.

* **Resolution Time**: We aim to resolve _in best effort_ all issues within 48 hours and will communicate the outcome back to the person who raised the issue.

## Why GitHub?

We chose GitHub for its openness and transparency. It allows us to:

* Connect directly with Investec's ticketing system, ServiceNow.
