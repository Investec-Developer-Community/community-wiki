# OfferZen

[OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/) is a job marketplace for software developers. They are a remote-first company, with employees across South Africa and Europe. Every team member has access to a shared team card to spend money and is given heuristics around how to spend, with the ultimate goal that everyone is empowered to do their job better.

### The Problem: Manually managing employee purchases and compiling spend data

Empowering employees to independently spend money requires a way to track expenses, without taking up valuable time from employees. OfferZen found that their finance team was spending hours every month trying to track and manage purchases.&#x20;

### &#x20;The Solution: Immediate expense claims and categorisation, and spend data formatting

The OfferZen team built **Roz** – a simple app that uses [Investec Programmable Banking](https://www.investec.com/en\_za/banking/tech-professionals/programmable-banking.html) and is affectionately named after the character from Monsters Inc. It works like this:

* All teams are given access to a shared Programmable Banking card to make purchases.
* Any spend on the card is sent to the appropriate team’s [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel, where they can claim the purchase, categorise it and upload their receipt via [Dext](https://dext.com/en).
* This information is fed into the app, which the finance team has administrative control over.
* The app updates the spend claims automatically and creates a CSV export into the format required for upload into their accounting software.&#x20;

### Winning with Programmable Banking&#x20;

* Employees are empowered to categorise their own spending, a process that would usually take the finance team a lot of time.
* Recurring expenses are automatically categorised each month.
* The CSV export saves the finance team from having to manually compile this information.

**If you want to use this solution for your business, the open-source project is available** [**here**](https://github.com/Offerzen/roz)**.**
