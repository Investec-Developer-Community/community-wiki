### The Problem: Manually managing and tracking employee purchases

The finance team would go through a monthly cycle to get all of the receipts from employees submitted - which would take almost 20 work days to complete. Both the bookkeepers and employees were spending a lot of time ensuring their accounting records were accurate.&#x20;

### The Solution: Immediate expense claims and categorisation

VATIT implemented a SlackBot, based on the [OfferZen team spend project](offerzen.md), which helps their employees claim and categorise their spends.

* Every time an employee spends money on their card, the transaction is posted to the appropriate team Slack channel.
* The employee to which the transaction belongs claims the purchase and categorises it.&#x20;

### Winning with Programmable Banking&#x20;

* The SlackBot has removed the need for the finance team to try to figure out who the spend belongs to.
* Employees can categorise their own transactions immediately in the Slack channel.&#x20;
* The solution has reduced the workload overall and VATIT has significantly reduced their 20 work day recon process. &#x20;
