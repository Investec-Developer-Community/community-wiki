We are super excited to launch this build challenge with [EskomSePush](https://sepush.co.za/) and see what can be imagined and built in this space.

If you’re interested in building solutions to relevant South African problems, are keen to explore a new API or have been waiting for a cool project to collaborate on with friends, you’re in the right place.

> 👉 If you are sold already, you can [register to participate here](https://forms.gle/A3CWtRhQr6T7Bdrv6).&#x20;

### What is the build challenge about?

Let’s face it, loadshedding sucks.

To make something good of a bad situation and have some fun in the process, we have teamed up with EskomSePush and **challenge you to build something with their API that knocks our socks off!**

EskomSePush will be giving those that participate exclusive access to their API for the duration of the challenge, and there will be some awesome EskomSePush and OfferZen up for grabs for those that submit a build.
