| Making transfers from the instructions sheet | If I set up macros and automations that need to make transfers or payments, being able to add a row to the transfers sheet would make it super easy to automate my cash flow!                                                                                                                                  | My sheet gets polled regularly for transfer instructions. If there are any new ones, it makes the transfer via the API and updates the transfer status on the sheet                                                         |        R15,000       |
| Controlling my cards                         | What even is RootCode? A kind of magic turnip? I only know how to use spreadsheets and I need to make sure all my cards are being used fairly                                                                                                                                                                  | When I update my cards sheet rules, it gets turned into a RootCode script and magically deployed onto my card.                                                                                                              |        R15,000       |
| Connecting a Telegram bot                    | Sending out a message courier is pretty high effort when you're busy. Being able to send and receive messages from inside this sheet lets me do all sorts of cool things... Using Telegram I could get custom spend alerts or even ask my AI-spreadsheet questions about my bank account and financial health! | Not sure, let's talk about it! There's a basic bot in the REPL that this sheet connects to as a starting point                                                                                                              |        R14,000       |
| Connecting Root insurance API                | Being able to insure my assets from inside this sheet would make life much easier. For starters, I wouldn't have to send my guards after those Tooks every time they break something..                                                                                                                         | Not sure, let's talk about it!                                                                                                                                                                                              |        R13,000       |
| Allowance account                            | Not everyone in the kingdom has a bank account. It would be great if I can give them one of my cards to use for my account, without them being able to spend all my money! They get to learn about finances and I don't go broke!                                                                              | Not sure, let's talk about it!                                                                                                                                                                                              |        R10,000       |
| Personalised AI finance tips                 | These days it feels like I need a Palantir to tell if I'm spending my gold smartly. Should I be investing more? Am I being too frugal?

| Registering a company                        | The people of Gondor are often starting new business ventures, but the paperwork is such a pain!

| Auto-budgeting                               | People say I should have a budget, but I don't even know where to start!

| Tax calculator                               | Somehow, even kings have to pay income tax.

| Investments sheet                            | The Gondorian stock market fluctuates whenever Sauron's power waxes and wanes.

| Use AI to categorize my transactions         | It's a bit laborious having to manage a lookup table, and it's not that smart at guessing my categories.

| Cash flow predictor                          | It's hard to manage cash flow even when you know roughly what expenses to expect. If I could have a forecast of my cash flow I'd feel much less stressed about finances. Plus I could make sure I'm saving up for bigger purchases.                                                                            | Not sure, let's talk about it!                                                                                                                                                                                              |   Unique swag pack   |
