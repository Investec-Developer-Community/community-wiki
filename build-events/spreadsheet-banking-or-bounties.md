I think AI could make this much more flexible and less effort for me to maintain.                                                           |                                         Let me choose which transactions to include as "sample data" for GPT3, and then get GPT3 to categorize each new transaction                                         |    Epic swag pack    |

Should I be investing more? Am I being too frugal?                                                                                     | Compare my transaction spend to my budget table and use the AI-powered Community Wik to give tips on how to improve my spending habits.
