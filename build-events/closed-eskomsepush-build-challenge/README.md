### Welcome!

We are super excited to launch this build challenge with [EskomSePush](https://sepush.co.za/) and see what can be imagined and built in this space.&#x20;

If you’re interested in building solutions to real South African problems, are keen to explore a new API or have been waiting for a cool project to collaborate on with friends, you’re in the right place.

### What is the build challenge about?

Let’s face it, loadshedding sucks.

To make something good of a bad situation and have some fun in the process, we have teamed up with EskomSePush and we **challenge you to build something with their API that knocks our socks off!**

EskomSePush will be giving those that participate exclusive access to their API for the duration of the challenge, and there will be some awesome EskomSePush and OfferZen socks up for grabs for those that submit a build.

You and your team are the credited ‘owners’ of your ideas, code and content. However, in the spirit of the community, you are required to open-source your code under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT); _see below for more info_.

You can chat with us in the dedicated [Slack channel](https://offerzen-community.slack.com/archives/C045L9FQZS5) or email [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) with any questions.

### **Who can participate, and how do I register?**

You can participate alone or as part of a team. You can be part of multiple teams if you want to.

We have opened this to members of the **OfferZen Programmable Banking community** and those in the ZATech Slack community that are already interested in building with the EskomSePush API.

* You can [register to participate here](https://forms.gle/A3CWtRhQr6T7Bdrv6).&#x20;
* Registration will close on **Friday 14th October at 16h00.**

### **How will I get access to the EskomSePush API if I want to participate?**

* Once you register for the build challenge, you will receive an email with a token for the EskomSePush API.
* The access token will provide you with 1000 credits. However, if you require more credits, you can request more by contacting [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com).
* Once the build challenge is over, the token will be revoked, and you will need to revert to a limited personal account that you can register for [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZhAkhDaQX\_mLT2xn41TkVjLkOH3Py3YWHi\_UqQP4niOY01g/viewform).

### **Are there use cases that I can build against?**

Absolutely!

If you don’t have any idea’s about what to build, we’ve got you covered. You can use these ideas or bring your own.

👉 **You can take a look at some interesting use cases**[ **here**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dalMqFwzcCCzY2jYyG5lMT7pYoMynh4Jgt9bgb\_ZKBY/present?slide=id.p).
