# ðŸ’³ Q2 2022 Hackathon | low-code/no-code

> [**Register here to join the Hackathon**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/edFvATSl) and let us know if you also require access to a live demo/ community account - rather than using your own Investec account.

If you are looking to test an API solution locally and quickly, check out this [community shared API simulator](https://github.com/devinpearson/programmable-banking-sim). ðŸ˜‰

## Build event details

Please reach out to [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) with any questions.&#x20;

Your team should build a solution that uses the Spreadsheet Banking app as part of your Investec's Programmable Banking solution to show how businesses can make life easier or create efficiencies for others.&#x20;

You must use the Spreadsheeting banking app in some way in your solution.

### ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips:**&#x20;

* Make sure you understand the Primary Criteria (**below**) before coming up with ideas.&#x20;
* Focus on the use case - you should explain the problem you are trying to solve, how someone would use your solution and why.
* Please **keep it simple**. If your solution saves someone 5 minutes a week - that's a meaningful impact on a real person's life!&#x20;
* Try to find smart workarounds if a platform limits you. **Your solution doesn't need to be rolled out at scale to score well.**&#x20;
* Ensure it works in production. For example, if you need to demonstrate a payment with a card, use SnapScan and donate R1.00 to a good cause.&#x20;
