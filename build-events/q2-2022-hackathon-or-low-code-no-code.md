# üí≥ Q2 2022 Hackathon | low-code/no-code

> [**Register here to join the Hackathon**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/edFvATSl) and let us know if you also require access to a live demo/ community account - rather than using your own Investec account.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are looking to test an API solution locally and quickly, check out this [community shared API simulator](https://github.com/devinpearson/programmable-banking-sim).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Build event details

Please reach out to [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) with any questions.&#x20;

Your team should build a solution that uses the Spreadsheet Banking app as part of your Investec's Programmable Banking solution to show how businesses can make life easier or create efficiencies for others.&#x20;

You must use the Spreadsheeting banking app in some way in your solution.

### üí° **Pro Tips:**&#x20;

* Make sure you understand the Primary Criteria (**below**) before coming up with ideas.&#x20;
* Focus on the use case - you should explain the problem you are trying to solve, how someone would use your solution and why.
* Please **keep it simple**. If your solution saves someone 5 minutes a week - that's a meaningful impact on a real person's life!&#x20;
* Try to find smart workarounds if a platform limits you. **Your solution doesn't need to be rolled out at scale to score well.**&#x20;
* Ensure it works in production. For example, if you need to demonstrate a payment with a card, use SnapScan and donate R1.00 to a good cause.&#x20;
* [Steal ideas](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/great-entrepreneurs-steal-ideas-walker-deibel/), but credit sources.

### **Details:**

#### **Teams:**

* Team size 1- 6 with one submission per team**.**&#x20;
* You can be in multiple teams - it's all about the submitted solutions.&#x20;
* Teams must have access or a way to access the Programmable Banking API / card functionalities to leverage them for the hackathon. (You can also [request access to a live Community Investec account](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) or [create a local API simulator](https://github.com/devinpearson/programmable-banking-sim).)

### **What do I need to know to submit my build?:**

You will be asked to provide the following when submitting your build:

* [ ] A link to an app/system solution that has been released under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and uses the Spreadsheet Banking app in some way \[you can also use the [Investec Programmable Card](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#features-included) and other features on [Investec Open API](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#open-api)].&#x20;
* [ ] Open source code repo and documentation for setting up your solution.&#x20;
* [ ] Two-minute video/ live demo of your solution showing how to use it and how it solves a business user's problem.&#x20;
* [ ] A brief description of how you used programmable banking and the transfer feature (see [one-page pitch template that should be used](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yk5F009f-4KPG9moysxEX40mmL1M45d0VCQj1zsOyHk/edit?usp=sharing))&#x20;
* [ ] Any other info you want the judges to know (motivations/ideas/process)&#x20;
* [ ] **Optional team photo üíú**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** A majority (80%+) of your design elements, code, etc., for your project/feature, must be created for the event - i.e. it can't be something that you have already built. \
**Your solution can use any language or framework.**
{% endhint %}

### What are the criteria for Sponsors looking at submissions?

The End-User Sponsors will be looking for a few things when considering how they will invest their **hard grazed cash**, including:

1. **Quality of the idea**: simplicity, creativity and originality of the idea&#x20;
2. **Potential strategic impact**: potential for improving businesses&#x20;
3. **Implementation of the concept**: ease of use, documentation and source code

{% hint style="warning" %}
**It is up to the Investor how they decide to view the submitted projects in light of each criterion. Their decisions are at their discretion.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Community Votes:** The general Programmable Banking community will also vote for their favourite solution.
{% endhint %}

### When are prizes announced?

We'll be contacting and announcing winners throughout the week after submission closes.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**NB**</mark>! To qualify as a winner, each team must perform a live demo of how their solution works and answer questions from the audience in a **10-minute slot at the Programmable Banking Meetup at 6:30 pm on 30 June 2022**. We will let winners know by 29 June that they have won to prepare for the demo.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**If no one from a winning team attends the meetup and demos their solution, that team will forfeit, and the runner up will be awarded their winnings - please carefully read ‚ÄúForfeit of teams‚Äù in the Rules section.**
{% endhint %}
