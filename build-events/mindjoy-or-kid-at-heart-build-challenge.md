# üë©üíª Mindjoy | Kid at Heart Build Challenge

## Welcome!

We are excited to announce our **Kid at** üíô **Build Challenge**, together with EdTech startup, [**Mindjoy**](https://www.mindjoy.com/)**.**&#x20;

One of the best ways to learn new and hard things like coding is to work on software projects that excite you, and believe it or not, this is true for grown-ups and kids alike.

****[**Project-based learning** ](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/luno-co-founder-carel-van-wyk-on-leveling-up-with-projects)is a great way to gain knowledge of new technical skills in greater depth and creates an opportunity for you to actively practice coding and keep your skills sharp.

Channel your inner kid and build that awesome project you wish you had as a 13-year-old!

If you‚Äôre sold already, you can register to participate **** [**here**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/grKy36U4)**.**

## What is the Kid at Heart Build Challenge about?

From 2023, Coding and Robotics will form part of the SA school curriculum. Through their engagement with schools, Mindjoy has learnt that educators are, however, unsure about how to introduce coding into their classrooms.

Software developers with deep domain knowledge and experience - _that‚Äôs you!_ - are well positioned to support kids' coding initiatives through building awesome software projects that can be broken down into engaging smaller modular projects for kids.

**This challenge is all about building a project that channels your inner kid, contributes to your learning journey and enables kids to have a fun learning experience too.**

We've teamed up with Mindjoy because they are all about creating great learning experiences that engage and challenge kids to learn real tech skills in a hands-on way.&#x20;

You can chat with us in the [dedicated Slack channel ](https://offerzen-community.slack.com/archives/C04APBL53D3)or email [community-investec@offerzen.com](mailto:community-investec@offerzen.com) with any questions.

## FAQs

### Who can participate and how do I register?

We have opened this challenge up to the developer community and you are welcome to invite your friends to participate.

You can participate alone or as part of a team and you can be part of multiple teams if you want to.

You can [**register to participate here.**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/grKy36U4)****

### Do I need to use a specific environment for kids to learn?

Yes, you will need to create your project in **Replit**. You can create a free account **** [**here.** ](https://replit.com/)****

Replit have some really nice and [easy-to-read guides ](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/overview)to get going quickly.

Replit is a great place for kids (and grown-ups) to learn how to code. They have recently launched [Replit Mobile](https://blog.replit.com/mobile-app) and are on a mission to make coding accessible to kids and adults in Africa.&#x20;

### Do I need to use a specific coding language for my project?

No, you can use any language supported by Replit.&#x20;

If you are wondering what languages are good for kids, [Python](https://www.python.org/) üêç is a great choice because it is easy to read, write and learn. This means that kids don‚Äôt need to go through strenuous learning before the fun begins. The syntax is also simple and it can be used to build complex programs.

### Woah I don‚Äôt know anything about teaching kids to code. Do I need to create a step-by-step lesson for kids?

**You just need to build the project and document it.** Mindjoy's superpower is taking awesome projects and breaking them into modules that kids of various experience levels can follow to create the project for themselves.

### Are there any project ideas that I can use to build against?

Absolutely, we‚Äôve got you covered. **You can take a look at the project ideas** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iDqbNfnUAv\_jEBx4fBZUON-7t5w04opuIaxIlNfhUAc/present?slide=id.p)**.**

Of course, you aren‚Äôt limited to building projects based on these ideas.
