# ðŸ§± Build Events

Hey Peeps!!!&#x20;

We were blown away by all the amazing projects you built and submitted for [our Q4 hackathon last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cWZQtru2zXkkVjEnbOZiCbwbTW1LcpgEsUalt1Vwlog/edit#gid=417688078) and hope that you are ready for the next one!&#x20;

This quarter, our hackathon theme is **Low-code/ No-code**. We are really looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with.&#x20;

The hackathon aims to promote the development of open-source software and collaboration between participants for the overall benefit of the community.&#x20;

> You can find out more about this quarter's challenge, prizes, and more [here](q2-2022-hackathon-or-low-code-no-code.md) as well as [**register your intent to participate**](https://8malmkzgvs8.typeform.com/to/edFvATSl) **or be a team mentor here**.

### **What is this hackathon about?**&#x20;

This is a virtual community hackathon. The challenge is to create **useful solutions for businesses**, using [Investec Programmable Banking](https://www.offerzen.com/community/investec/) leveraging Spreadsheet banking.\

### **Who can participate?**&#x20;

You may participate alone, but we highly recommend working in a team.&#x20;

Please note, at least one person on your team must have access to an [Investec Private Bank Account](https://www.investec.com/en\_za.html) and have Programmable Banking activated on their account ([developer docs here](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#programmable-banking)) - as you need to build a solution that is integrated with it.&#x20;

**The closing date for your final solution is Friday 17 June, 23:59 SAST.**&#x20;

Each submission must include:

* [ ] A link to an app/system/solution that has been released under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and uses the Spreadsheet banking app \[you can also use the [Investec Programmable Card](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#features-included) and other features on [Investec Open API](https://developer.investec.com/programmable-banking/#open-api)].&#x20;
* [ ] Open source code repo and documentation for setting up your solution.&#x20;
* [ ] Two-minute video/ live demo of your solution showing how to use it and how it solves a business user's problem.&#x20;
* [ ] A brief description of the problem your solution solves, how your solution works and how it makes use of Programmable Banking and Spreadsheet banking as well as the benefits of your solution (see [one-page pitch template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yk5F009f-4KPG9moysxEX40mmL1M45d0VCQj1zsOyHk/edit?usp=sharing) that should be used)&#x20;
